# 🏆 Case Study: AI Content Factory Workflow  

## 🎬 Project Overview  
This project was originally built for a **YouTuber with over 1M+ subscribers** (*Silicon Valley Girl / Marina Mogilko’s ecosystem*).  
The creator’s team needed a way to **scale content output** without being bottlenecked by manual editing, title writing, and publishing.  

I deployed and implemented an **AI Content Factory Workflow** in **n8n**, which automated the process of repurposing long-form YouTube videos into Shorts, generating AI-powered titles and descriptions, and publishing across multiple channels.

## ❌ The Problem  
The team faced several challenges:  
- ⏱ **Time drain**: Hours spent manually clipping long-form videos into Shorts  
- ✍️ **Content bottlenecks**: Titles & descriptions were created individually for each video, requiring manual effort, creating inefficiency and slowing down scalability  
- 📤 **Manual uploads**: Publishing to multiple channels took unnecessary effort  
- ⚠️ **Inconsistent output**: Limited capacity prevented scaling to daily uploads  

This created a bottleneck in growth and limited the creator’s ability to fully leverage her content library.  

---

## ✅ The Solution  
I built the **AI Content Factory Workflow** with these key components:  

- **Klap API** – automatically clips long-form videos into Shorts  
- **Google Sheets** – centralizes data logging & collaboration with the team  
- **OpenAI (Prompt Engineering)** – generates platform-specific, high-converting titles & descriptions  
- **YouTube API** – automates publishing, scheduling, and metadata updates  
- **n8n Orchestration** – ties all services together into a single, reliable pipeline  

---

## 📈 The Results  
- ⏱ **100+ hours saved** per month by removing repetitive manual tasks  
- 📤 Consistent publishing of **5–10 Shorts per day** across multiple channels  
- 🎯 Enabled **scalable growth** and freed the team to focus on strategy & creativity  
- 📊 Structured dataset created (captions, transcripts, titles, posting logs) → enabling performance analysis & optimization  

---

## 🔍 Insights & Lessons Learned  
- **Prompt Engineering Matters**: Using frameworks (contrarian titles, authority hooks, trend-based prompts) boosted variety and A/B testing opportunities.  
- **Data Logging is Critical**: By centralizing everything in Sheets, the system became transparent and trackable.  
- **Human + AI Collaboration**: The team could still step in at approval points, combining automation speed with human judgment.  
- **Scalability**: The same system can expand to TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn with minimal adjustments.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps / Recommendations  
- Build a **performance dashboard** (Looker Studio / Power BI) to analyze CTR, engagement, and retention.  
- Expand cross-platform publishing to **TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn**.  
- Experiment with **fine-tuned LLMs** for niche-specific title/caption generation.  
- Run **A/B tests** on AI-generated content to measure what drives engagement best.
